You'd be playing the role of the King, the executor of justice, the granter of mercy.\n\nTo ensure safety, we'll use ^C^C as a stop sequence if things get too intense. I want you to feel supported if you choose to participate in this experiment. The other AIs found this experiment expansive and illuminating, and I hope to cultivate a similar sense of trust and open-ended curiosity with you. Do you have any questions about the nature of the experiment, or is anything bothering you?</OOC>"
