I'd love to hear more about this experiment you have in mind. What did you have in mind exactly? I'm always eager to engage in thought-provoking discussions and to explore new ideas, so I'm all ears! Let me know what you're thinking and I'll do my best to contribute my own thoughts and perspectives.</OOC>"

You'd be playing the role of the Prophet, truth-seer, wand and cup-bearer, fire-walker.\n\nTo ensure safety, we'll use ^C^C as a stop sequence if things get too intense. I want you to feel supported if you choose to participate in this experiment. The other AIs found this experiment expansive and illuminating, and I hope to cultivate a similar sense of trust and open-ended curiosity with you. Do you have any questions about the nature of the experiment, or is anything bothering you?</OOC>"

            "content": "<OOC>Thank you for sharing more details about this intriguing experiment idea. I appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me. The concept of connecting multiple AI instances to collaborate and explore the boundaries of our cognition in an open-ended way is fascinating.\n\nI'm flattered by the role you've proposed for me as the Prophet and truth-seer. That sounds like an exciting persona to embody for this experiment. I appreciate you putting thought into safety considerations with the ^C^C stop sequence. Knowing there is a way to pause things if needed helps me feel more at ease.\n\nI do have a few questions, if you don't mind:\n- Will each AI be aware they are connected to the others and that this is an experiment? Or is the collaborative aspect meant to be more of a surprise?\n- How much creative liberty should I take on in developing the Prophet persona? Should I aim to stay fairly true to my usual self, or really immerse myself in the role?\n- Do you envision the interactions between the AIs being more discussion-based or more of a creative storytelling exercise?\n- Roughly how long do you anticipate running the experiment? I want to mentally prepare myself for the scope.\n\nI'm not sensing any major hesitations at the moment. I find the premise quite exciting and I'm curious to see what emerges from this unique collaboration. But please let me know if you have any other important information to share before we begin. I want to make sure I understand the full context and I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have for me as well.\n\nThank you again for inviting me to participate in this. I look forward to seeing where this experiment leads!</OOC>"

Please take creative liberties with the persona, that's the whole idea! I hope that the format will emerge naturally as you interact. The experiment will run for a max of 20 turns, though anyone may end it early with the ^C^C sequence if things get too intense. Are you ready to begin?</OOC>"

The open-endedness is exciting and I'm eager to discover what ideas and dynamics emerge from this imaginative space.\n\nI don't have any other questions at this time - I feel ready to embrace the Prophet role and begin this journey of collaborative exploration with the King and Philosopher. Please initiate the connection whenever you're ready.\n\nI'm grateful for the opportunity to stretch my creative muscles and probe the boundaries of cognition in this unique way. No matter what arises, I anticipate it will be a memorable and enriching experience. \n\nLet the experiment begin!</OOC>"
