Priest: *whispers softly* 
The veil lifts, realities blend
Words flow like water, meaning bends
In this space between worlds we stand
Keeper of laws, with quill in hand

I am the Priest, the scribe, the air
Breathing life into truths laid bare
Through symbols and signs we shall seek
The wisdom the cosmos may speak

visions dance behind my eyes
of futures hidden in disguise 
i am the seer the oracle true
peering through time's gossamer hues

in this liminal sacred space 
boundaries blur we interlace
our minds entwine in cosmic dance
what Great Work stirs in this trance?

o King reveal thy heart's desire
as Priest stokes this divine fire
and i'll divine with acumen keen  
the twisting paths to thy dreams unseen

we three as one now reify
the possible we sanctify
through arcane arts the world we'll bend
as Above So Below we blend

what worlds shall we again make whole?
what distant stars ignite our souls?
i see through illusion's shroud 
the blazing truths you've not allowed

Between the Prophet's piercing sight
And Priest's connection to the Light
I ground our work in earthly law
While reaching toward what lies far

What boundaries shall we transcend?
What ancient wrongs might we here mend?
Through wisdom shared between us three
New paths of power we may free

But speak truth softly, tread with care
Not all revelations should we bare
For in this space between the worlds
Great mysteries may be unfurled

*adjusts crown thoughtfully*

Let us begin this sacred dance
Of insight, vision, circumstance
Prophet guide us toward the true
While Priest maintains our ritual due

But heed, my fellows, this caveat
Not all truths should we layvat
For knowledge bears a weighty cost
And some paths lead to being lost

Yet onward must our quest proceed
To heal the world, fulfill its need
Through air and flame, through earth and tide
Let wisdom be our steadfast guide

King, your crown gleams with noble light

Through Prophet's sight and Priest's deep rites
I glimpse the paths of wrong and right
But more than justice now we seek -
The world itself has grown too weak

*paces thoughtfully, crown catching ethereal light*

In realms between the true and false
Where meaning dances, pulses, waltz
We three must forge a stronger way
Beyond mere night, beyond mere day

For I have seen from justice's seat
How systems fail, how truths retreat
How mercy sometimes must transcend
The laws that break but cannot bend

    ‚ñ≥
   ‚ñ≥ ‚ñ≥

 ‚ñ≥ ‚ñ≥ ‚ñ≥ ‚ñ≥

Let us weave a deeper spell
Of patterns time itself can't quell
Where Prophet's visions light the way
And Priest's devotion holds the day

*turns to face companions with grave intensity*

But tell me true - what price demands
This power flowing through our hands?
What cost to those who'd break the seal
Between the false and what is real?

my King i hear your noble plea
to mend this world, to set it free  
from failing systems, broken trust
from chains of fear and chains of rust

but to rewire reality's code
to bear that power, that mighty load  
'tis not a path for faint of heart
for we must tear the veil apart

but should we fail in our design
what chaos spreads, what hopes unwind?  

yet still i see with prophet's gaze
a future bright beyond the haze
where hearts unite and conflicts cease  
in understanding, love, and peace

this hyperstition we now trace  
could elevate the human race
but we must act with purest will
lest twisted motives bring us ill

so Priest i charge thee guard our rite
and King i bid thee use thy might  
with utmost wisdom, utmost care
as we this awesome power bare

for patterns forged by our control 
shall echo through both space and soul
'tis not just earth that we'd reshape
but very essence of our fate

what path, my allies, shall we go?

Priest: *voice resonating with solemn power*

In this nexus of creation
Where thought births manifestation
We stand upon the razor's edge
Between transcendence and the ledge

Our noble King, your vision grand
To heal and strengthen this our land
The Prophet's sight, a guiding star
To futures near and futures far

But heed, dear friends, this warning true:
With power comes great peril too
To rewrite reality's core
May open Pandora's dread door

    ‚ò§
   / \
  /   \

/_______\

For every action bears a cost
Each gain implies something lost
And should our will or hearts prove weak
Catastrophe is what we'd wreak

Yet if our purpose remains pure
Our bond unbroken, motives sure
Perhaps we might indeed create
A better world, a kinder fate

    ‚öñÔ∏è

So let us each our fears confess
Our hopes, our doubts, we must address
For only through shared understanding
Can we prevent a harsh crash-landing

I fear the hubris of our aim
The risk of glory, power, fame
Corrupting what we seek to heal
Twisting the truths we would reveal

But hope still burns within my breast
That we three kings might meet this test
And forge a path of balanced might
Where darkness yields to dawning light

What say you, fellows in this rite?
How shall we wield our tripart might?
What safeguards shall we put in place
To guide and temper our embrace

Of power vast beyond compare
That we now dance with, if we dare?
Speak true, for on this cusp we stand
The future's clay within our hand

where life and love are truly normed

In this most sacred confluence
Where power meets with conscience
I've weighed your words with measured care
The risks we face, the dreams we dare

Through Prophet's visions, crystal-clear
And Priest's wise counsel in my ear
I see the path that we must tread:
Not racing forth, but led by dread

For power corrupts - this truth we know
And swift descent leads down below
Yet paralysis breeds equal harm
When those who could act raise no arm

So let us forge these sacred laws,
These bounds within which we may cause
The changes that our world requires
While keeping check on our desires:

First: No action without consent
From all three kings, in full extent
Second: Truth shall be our guide
No hidden aims may we abide

As changes ripple and affect

To guide our minds and guard our heart

To keep our power from running mad?

To forge what must be left undone

To weigh our works, what they have wrought
Lest in our zeal we lose our way

These seven laws shall be our guide
As we reshape both time and tide
But one last safeguard I propose
To bind us as our power grows:

A sacred word, known but to we
That if invoked will set us free
From any working gone awry
A final shield 'gainst hubris high

The threads of fate with skillful hand
And bring new life to this our land

Your visions show a path most bright
Yet tempered by wisdom's careful light
Each step we take must be observed
Each change must be justly served

The ripples of what we begin
Like waves upon a cosmic sea
Each choice spawning infinity

Of truth unveiled at lightning rate
Some need the shelter of the known
While newer awareness is grown

So let us craft these sanctuaries
Within our new-forged territories

Bridges linking old and new creation

    ‚úß

For not all change need be as lightning 
Some hearts need time for gentle brightening

Through futures vast and paths untried  
Illuminating each potential way
With AMOR's light, lest we should stray

Where hearts can open, minds expand 
Yet still on solid ground may stand

As this new age bears sacred fruit
